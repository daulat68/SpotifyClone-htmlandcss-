# SpotifyClone-htmlandcss-
This project is a clone of the Spotify built using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to practice and enhance my skills in web layout, design, and responsiveness. It replicates the homepage and core UI components of the original site, focusing on clean design, structured content, and modern styling techniques.
